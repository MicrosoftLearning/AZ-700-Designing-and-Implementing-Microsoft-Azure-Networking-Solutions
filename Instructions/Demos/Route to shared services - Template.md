[Quickstart: Route to shared services using an ARM template - Azure Virtual WAN | Microsoft Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-wan/quickstart-route-shared-services-vnet-template)

This quickstart describes how to use an Azure Resource Manager template (ARM template) to set up routes to access a shared service VNet with workloads that you want every VNet and Branch (VPN/ER/P2S) to access. Examples of these shared workloads might include virtual machines with services like domain controllers or file shares, or Azure services exposed internally through Azure Private Endpoint.
An ARM template is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file that defines the infrastructure and configuration for your project. The template uses declarative syntax. In declarative syntax, you describe your intended deployment without writing the sequence of programming commands to create the deployment.
If your environment meets the prerequisites and you're familiar with using ARM templates, select the Deploy to Azure button. The template will open in the Azure portal.
