# M06-Unit 7 Deploy and configure Azure Firewall using the Azure portal

## Exercise scenario

Being part of the Network Security team at Contoso, your next task is to create firewall rules to allow/deny access to certain websites. The following steps walk you through creating a resource group, a virtual network and subnets, and a virtual machine as environment preparation tasks, and then deploying a firewall and firewall policy, configuring default routes and application, network and DNAT rules, and finally testing the firewall.

## Task 3: Create a virtual machine

In this task, you will create the workload virtual machine and place it in the Workload-SN subnet created previously.

1. In the Azure portal, select the Cloud Shell icon (top right). If necessary, configure the shell.  
    + Select **PowerShell**.
    + Select **No Storage Account required** and your **Subscription**, then select **Apply**.
    + Wait for the terminal to create and a prompt to be displayed. 

1. In the toolbar of the Cloud Shell pane, select the **Manage files** icon, in the drop-down menu, select **Upload** and upload the following files **firewall.json** and **firewall.parameters.json** into the Cloud Shell home directory.

    > **Note:** If you are working in your own subscription the [template files](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/AZ-700-Designing-and-Implementing-Microsoft-Azure-Networking-Solutions/tree/master/Allfiles/Exercises) are available in the GitHub lab repository.

1. Deploy the following ARM templates to create the VM needed for this exercise:

   >**Note**: You will be prompted to provide an Admin password.

   ```powershell
   $RGName = "Test-FW-RG"
   
   New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName $RGName -TemplateFile firewall.json -TemplateParameterFile firewall.parameters.json
   ```
  
1. When the deployment is complete, go to the Azure portal home page, and then select **Virtual Machines**.

1. Verify that the virtual machine has been created.

1. On the **Overview** page of **Srv-Work**, on the right of the page under **Networking**, take a note of the **Private IP address** for this VM (e.g., **10.0.2.4**).

â  ![Add a DNAT rule collection](../media/add-a-dnat-rule.png)

1. Select **Add**.

## Task 9: Change the primary and secondary DNS address for the server'sÂ network interface

For testing purposes in this exercise, in this task, you will configure the Srv-Work server's primary and secondary DNS addresses. However, this is not a general Azure Firewall requirement.

1. On the Azure portal home page, select **Resource groups**.

1. In the list of resource groups, select your resource group, **Test-FW-RG**.

1. In the list of resources in this resource group, select the network interface for the **Srv-Work** virtual machine (e.g., **srv-work350**).

   ![Select NIC in resource group](../media/change-dns-servers-srv-work-nic-1.png)

1. Under **Settings**, select **DNS servers**.

1. Under **DNS servers**, select **Custom**.

1. enter **209.244.0.3** in the **Add DNS server** text box, and **209.244.0.4** in the next text box.

1. Select **Save**.

   ![Change DNS servers on NIC](../media/change-dns-servers-srv-work-nic-2.png)

1. Restart the **Srv-Work** virtual machine.

## Task 10: Test the firewall

In this final task, you will test the firewall to verify that the rules are configured correctly and working as expected. This configuration will enable you to connect a remote desktop connection to the Srv-Work virtual machine through the firewall, via the firewall's public IP address.

1. Open **Remote Desktop Connection** on your PC.

1. On the **Computer** box, enter the firewall's public IP address (e.g., **20.90.136.51**) followed by **:3389** (e.g., **20.90.136.51:3389**).

1. On the **Username** box, enter **TestUser**.

1. Select **Connect**.

   ![RDP connection to firewall's public IP address](../media/remote-desktop-connection-1.png)

1. On the **Enter your credentials** dialog box, log into the **Srv-Work** server virtual machine, by using the password you provided during deployment.

1. Select **OK**.

1. Select **Yes** on the certificate message.

1. Open Internet Explorer and browse to **<https://www.google.com>**.

1. On the **Security Alert** dialog box, select **OK**.

1. Select **Close** on the Internet Explorer security alerts that may pop-up.

1. You should see the Google home page.

    ![RDP session on Srv-work server - browser on google.com](../media/remote-desktop-connection-2.png)

1. Browse to **<https://www.microsoft.com>**.

1. You should be blocked by the firewall.

    ![RDP session on Srv-work server - browser blocked on microsoft.com](../media/remote-desktop-connection-3.png)

## Clean up resources

   >**Note**: Remember to remove any newly created Azure resources that you no longer use. Removing unused resources ensures you will not see unexpected charges.

1. On the Azure portal, open the **PowerShell** session within the **Cloud Shell** pane.

1. Delete all resource groups you created throughout the labs of this module by running the following command:

   ```powershell
   Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name 'Test-FW-RG' -Force -AsJob
   ```

   >**Note**: The command executes asynchronously (as determined by the -AsJob parameter), so while you will be able to run another PowerShell command immediately afterwards within the same PowerShell session, it will take a few minutes before the resource groups are actually removed.

## Extend your learning with Copilot

Copilot can assist you in learning how to use the Azure scripting tools. Copilot can also assist in areas not covered in the lab or where you need more information. Open an Edge browser and choose Copilot (top right) or navigate to *copilot.microsoft.com*. Take a few minutes to try these prompts.
+ Provide three common usage scenarios for firewalls. 
+ Provide a table comparing the features of the Azure Firewall SKUs.
+ Describe the three types of rules you can create for an Azure Firewall.

## Learn more with self-paced training

+ [Introduction to Azure Firewall](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/introduction-azure-firewall/). In this module, you learn how Azure Firewall protects Azure virtual network resources including features, rules, and deployment options.
+ [Introduction to Azure Firewall Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/intro-to-azure-firewall-manager/). In this module, you learn how Azure Firewall Manager provides central security policy and route management for cloud-based security perimeters.

## Key takeaways

Congratulations on completing the lab. Here are the main takeaways for this lab. 
+ A firewall is a network security feature that sits between a trusted network and an untrusted network, such as the internet. The firewall's job is to analyze and then allow or deny network traffic.
+ Azure Firewall is a cloud-based firewall service. In most configurations, Azure Firewall is provisioned inside a hub virtual network. Traffic to and from the spoke virtual networks and the on-premises network is directed to the firewall.
+ Firewall rules evaulate the network traffic. Azure Firewall has three types of rules: Application, Network, and NAT. 
+ Azure Firewall is offered in three SKUs: Standard, Premium, and Basic.
