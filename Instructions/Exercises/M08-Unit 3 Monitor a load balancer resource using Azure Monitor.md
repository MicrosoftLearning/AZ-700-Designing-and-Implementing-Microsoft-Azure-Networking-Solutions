# M08-Unit 3 Monitor a load balancer resource using Azure Monitor

## Exercise scenario

In this exercise, you will create an internal load balancer for the fictional Contoso Ltd organization. Then you will create a Log Analytics workspace, and use Azure Monitor Insights to view information about your internal load balancer. You will view the Functional Dependency View, then view detailed metrics for the load balancer resource, and view resource health information for the load balancer. Finally, you will configure the load balancer's diagnostic settings to send metrics to the Log Analytics workspace you created.

The diagram below illustrates the environment you will be deploying in this exercise.

## Task 1: Create the virtual network

In this section, you will create a virtual network and a subnet.

1. Log in to the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, search for and select **Virtual Networks**.

1. Select **+ Create**.

   ![Create virtual network](../media/create-virtual-network.png)

1. On the **Basics** tab, use the information in the table below to create the virtual network.

   | **Setting**    | **Value**                                           |
   | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
   | Subscription   | Select your subscription                            |
   | Resource group | Select **Create new**<br /><br />Name: **IntLB-RG** |
   | Name           | **IntLB-VNet**                                      |
   | Region         | **(US) West US**                                    |

1. Select **Next : Security**.

1. Under **BastionHost** select **Enable**, then enter the information from the table below.

    | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
    | Bastion name                      | **myBastionHost**                                      |
    | Public IP address                 | Select **Create new**<br /><br />Name: **myBastionIP** |

1. Select **Next : IP Addresses**.

1. **Delete IP address**, then **IPv4 address space**. Enter **10.1.0.0/16**.

1. Edit the **AzureBastionSubnet** and change the **Starting address** to **10.1.1.0**. **Save** the change. 

1. Select **+ Add subnet**, the subnet name is `myBackendSubnet`, and the subnet address range is `10.1.0.0/24`. Select **Add**.

1. You should now have a virtual network with two subnets. 

1. Select **Review + create**.

1. Select **Create**.

## Task 2: Create the load balancer

In this section, you will create an internal Standard SKU load balancer. The reason we are creating a Standard SKU load balancer here in the exercise, instead of a Basic SKU load balance, is for later exercises that require a Standard SKU version of the load balancer.

1. In the Azure portal, search for and select **Load Balancers**

1. Select **Create**, and then **Standard Load Balancer**.

1. On the **Basics** tab, use the information in the table below to create the load balancer.

   | **Setting**           | **Value**                |
   | --------------------- | ------------------------ |
   | Basics tab            |                          |
   | Subscription          | Select your subscription |
   | Resource group        | **IntLB-RG**             |
   | Name                  | **myIntLoadBalancer**    |
   | Region                | **(US) West US**         |
   | SKU                   | **Standard**             |
   | Type                  | **Internal**             |

1. Move to the **Frontend IP configuration tab** and select **+ Add a frontend IP configuration**.

   | **Setting**            | **Value**            |
   | Name                  | `LoadBalancerFrontEnd` |
   | Virtual network       | **IntLB-VNet**           |
   | Subnet                | **myBackendSubnet**      |
   | IP address assignment | **Dynamic**              |

1. **Save** your changes, then select **Review + create**.

1. After a successful validation, select **Create**.

## Task 3: Create a backend pool

The backend address pool contains the IP addresses of the virtual NICs connected to the load balancer.

1. In the Azure portal, search for and select the **myIntLoadBalancer** resource.

1. Under **Settings**, select **Backend pools**, and then select **Add**.

1. On the **Add backend pool** page, enter the information from the table below.

   | **Setting**     | **Value**            |

   | Name            | **myBackendPool**    |
   | Virtual network | IntLB-VNet    |
   | Backend Pool Configuration   | **NIC** |

1. Select **Save**.

   ![Show backend pool created in load balancer](../media/create-backendpool.png)

## Task 4: Create a health probe

The load balancer monitors the status of your app with a health probe. The health probe adds or removes VMs from the load balancer based on their response to health checks. Here you will create a health probe to monitor the health of the VMs.

1. For the load balancer resource, select **Settings**, select **Health probes**, then select **Add**.

1. On the **Add health probe** page, enter the information from the table below.

   | **Setting**         | **Value**         |
   | ------------------- | ----------------- |
   | Name                | `myHealthProbe` |
   | Protocol            | **HTTP**          |
   | Port                | **80**            |
   | Path                | **/**             |
   | Interval            | **15**            |

1. Select **Save**.

   ![Show health probe created in load balancer](../media/create-healthprobe.png)

## Task 5: Create a load balancer rule

A load balancer rule is used to define how traffic is distributed to the VMs. You define the frontend IP configuration for the incoming traffic and the backend IP pool to receive the traffic. The source and destination port are defined in the rule. Here you will create a load balancer rule.

1. For the load balancer resource, select **Settings**, select **Load balancing rules**, then select **Add**.

   | **Setting**            | **Value**                |
   | ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
   | Name                   | **myHTTPRule**           |
   | IP Version             | **IPv4**                 |
   | Frontend IP address    | **LoadBalancerFrontEnd** |
   | Backend pool           | **myBackendPool**        |
   | Protocol               | **TCP**                  |
   | Port                   | **80**                   |
   | Backend port           | **80**                   |
   | Health probe           | **myHealthProbe**        |
   | Session persistence    | **None**                 |
   | Idle timeout (minutes) | **15**                   |
   | Floating IP            | **Disabled**             |

   ![Show load balancing rule created in load balancer](../media/create-loadbalancerrule.png)

## Task 6: Create backend servers

## Clean up resources

>**Note**: Remember to remove any newly created Azure resources that you no longer use. Removing unused resources ensures you will not see unexpected charges.

1. On the Azure portal, open the **PowerShell** session within the **Cloud Shell** pane.

1. Delete all resource groups you created throughout the labs of this module by running the following command:

   ```powershell
   Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name 'IntLB-RG' -Force -AsJob
   ```

>**Note**: The command executes asynchronously (as determined by the -AsJob parameter), so while you will be able to run another PowerShell command immediately afterwards within the same PowerShell session, it will take a few minutes before the resource groups are actually removed.
