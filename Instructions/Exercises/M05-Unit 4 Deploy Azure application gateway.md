# M05-Unit 4 Deploy Azure Application Gateway

## Exercise scenario

In this exercise, you use the Azure portal to create an application gateway. Then you test it to make sure it works correctly.

![Diagram of application gateway architecture.](../media/4-exercise-deploy-azure-application-gateway.png)

### Estimated time: 25 minutes

The application gateway directs application web traffic to specific resources in a backend pool. You assign listeners to ports, create rules, and add resources to a backend pool. For the sake of simplicity, this article uses a simple setup with a public front-end IP, a basic listener to host a single site on the application gateway, a basic request routing rule, and two virtual machines in the backend pool.

For Azure to communicate between the resources that you create, it needs a virtual network. You can either create a new virtual network or use an existing one. In this example, you'll create a new virtual network while you create the application gateway. Application Gateway instances are created in separate subnets. You create two subnets in this example: one for the application gateway, and another for the backend servers.

### Job skills

In this exercise, you will:

+ Task 1: Create an application gateway
+ Task 2: Create virtual machines

1. It may take several minutes for Azure to create the application gateway. Wait until the deployment finishes successfully.

### Add a subnet for a backend servers

1. Search for and select the **ContosoVNet**. Verify the **AGSubnet** was created. 

1. To create the **BackendSubnet**, select **Settings** and then **Subnets**. Be sure to **Add** the subnet when finished.
   
   | **Setting**       | **Value**                          |

   | Address range     | 10.0.1.0/24                        |

## Task 2: Create virtual machines

1. In the Azure portal, select the Cloud Shell icon (top right). If necessary, configure the shell.  
    + Select **PowerShell**.
    + Select **No Storage Account required** and your **Subscription**, then select **Apply**.
    + Wait for the terminal to create and a prompt to be displayed.
      
1. On the toolbar of the Cloud Shell pane, select **Manage files** and then **Upload**. Upload the following files: **backend.json**, **backend.parameters.json**, and **install-iis.ps1**.

    >**Note:** If you are working in your own subscription the [template files](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/AZ-700-Designing-and-Implementing-Microsoft-Azure-Networking-Solutions/tree/master/Allfiles/Exercises) are available in the GitHub lab repository.

1. Deploy the following ARM templates to create the VMs needed for this exercise:

   >**Note**: You will be prompted to provide an Admin password. 

   ```powershell
   $RGName = "ContosoResourceGroup"
   
   New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName $RGName -TemplateFile backend.json -TemplateParameterFile backend.parameters.json
   ```
   >**Note**: Take time to review the **backend.json** file. There are two virtual machines being deployed. This will take a few minutes. 

1. The command should complete successfully and list **BackendVM1** and **BackendVM2**.

### Install IIS on each virtual machine

1. Each backend server needs IIS installed.

1. Continue at the PowerShell prompt and use the provided script to install IIS on **BackendVM1**.

   ```powershell
   Invoke-AzVMRunCommand -ResourceGroupName 'ContosoResourceGroup' -Name 'BackendVM1' -CommandId 'RunPowerShellScript' -ScriptPath 'install-iis.ps1'
   ```

   >**Note**: While you wait review the PowerShell script. Notice that the IIS home page is being customized to provide the virtual machine name.

1. Run the command again, this time for **BackendVM2**.

   ```powershell
   Invoke-AzVMRunCommand -ResourceGroupName 'ContosoResourceGroup' -Name 'BackendVM2' -CommandId 'RunPowerShellScript' -ScriptPath 'install-iis.ps1'
   ```
   >**Note**: Each command will take a couple of minutes to complete.

## Task 3: Add backend servers to backend pool

1. On the Azure portal menu, select **All resources** or search for and select All resources. Then select **ContosoAppGateway**.

1. Under **Settings**, select **Backend pools**.

1. Select **BackendPool**.

1. On the Edit backend pool page, under **Backend targets**, in **Target type**, select **Virtual machine**.

1. Under **Target**, select **BackendVM1-nic.**

1. On **Target type**, select **Virtual machine**.

1. Under **Target**, select **BackendVM2-nic.**

   ![Azure Portal add target backends to backend pool](../media/edit-backend-pool.png)

1. Select **Save** and wait for the targets to be added. 

1. Check to ensure the backend servers are healthy. Select **Monitoring** and then **Backend Health**. Both targets should be healthy. 

   ![Azure Portal check backend health.](../media/contoso-backend-health.png)

## Task 4: Test the application gateway

Although IIS isn't required to create the application gateway, you installed it in this exercise to verify if Azure successfully created the application gateway.

### Use IIS to test the application gateway

1. Find the public IP address for the application gateway on its **Overview** page.

   ![Azure Portal look up Frontend Public IP address ](../media/app-gw-public-ip.png)

1. Copy the public IP address, and then paste it into the address bar of your browser to browse that IP address.

1. Check the response. A valid response verifies that the application gateway was successfully created and can successfully connect with the backend.

   ![Broswer - display BackendVM1 or BackendVM2 depending which backend server reponds to request.](../media/browse-to-backend.png)

1. Refresh the browser multiple times and you should see connections to both BackendVM1 and BackendVM2.

## Clean up resources

   >**Note**: Remember to remove any newly created Azure resources that you no longer use. Removing unused resources ensures you will not see unexpected charges.

1. On the Azure portal, open the **PowerShell** session within the **Cloud Shell** pane.

1. Delete all resource groups you created throughout the labs of this module by running the following command:

   ```powershell
   Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name 'IntLB-RG' -Force -AsJob
   ```

>**Note**: The command executes asynchronously (as determined by the -AsJob parameter), so while you will be able to run another PowerShell command immediately afterwards within the same PowerShell session, it will take a few minutes before the resource groups are actually removed.

## Key takeaways

Congratulations on completing the lab. Here are the main takeaways for this lab. 
+ Azure Application Gateway is a web traffic (OSI layer 7) load balancer that enables you to manage traffic to your web applications.
+ Application Gateway can make routing decisions based on additional attributes of an HTTP request, for example URI path or host headers.
+ Use Application Gateway for application hosted in a single region and when you need URL based routing.
