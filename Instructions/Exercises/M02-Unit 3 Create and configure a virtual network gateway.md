# M02-Unit 3 Create and configure a virtual network gateway

In this exercise you will configure a virtual network gateway to connect the Contoso Core Services VNet and Manufacturing VNet. 

In this exercise, you will:

+ Task 1: Create CoreServicesVnet and ManufacturingVnet
+ Task 2: Create CoreServicesVM
+ Task 3: Create ManufacturingVM
+ Task 4: Connect to the Test VMs using RDP
+ Task 5: Test the connection between the VMs
+ Task 6: Create CoreServicesVnet Gateway
+ Task 7: Create ManufacturingVnet Gateway
+ Task 8: CoreServicesVnet to ManufacturingVnet 
+ Task 9: Connect ManufacturingVnet to CoreServicesVnet
+ Task 10: Verify that the connections connect 
+ Task 11: Test the connection between the VMs

**Note:** An **[interactive lab simulation](https://mslabs.cloudguides.com/guides/AZ-700%20Lab%20Simulation%20-%20Create%20and%20configure%20a%20virtual%20network%20gateway)** is available that allows you to click through this lab at your own pace. You may find slight differences between the interactive simulation and the hosted lab, but the core concepts and ideas being demonstrated are the same.

#### Estimated time: 70 minutes (including ~45 minutes deployment waiting time)

1. Deploy the following ARM templates to create the virtual network and subnets needed for this exercise:

   ```powershell
   $RGName = "ContosoResourceGroup"
   #create resource group if it doesnt exist
   New-AzResourceGroup -Name $RGName -Location "eastus"
   New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName $RGName -TemplateFile azuredeploy.json -TemplateParameterFile azuredeploy.parameters.json
   ```

## Task 2: Create CoreServicesVM

1. On the toolbar of the Cloud Shell pane, select the **Upload/Download files** icon, in the drop-down menu, select **Upload** and upload the following files **CoreServicesVMazuredeploy.json** and **CoreServicesVMazuredeploy.parameters.json** into the Cloud Shell home directory one by one from the source folder **F:\Allfiles\Exercises\M02**.

1. Deploy the following ARM templates to create the VMs needed for this exercise:

   >**Note**: You will be prompted to provide an Admin password.

   ```powershell
   $RGName = "ContosoResourceGroup"
   
   New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName $RGName -TemplateFile CoreServicesVMazuredeploy.json -TemplateParameterFile CoreServicesVMazuredeploy.parameters.json
   ```
  
1. When the deployment is complete, go to the Azure portal home page, and then select **Virtual Machines**.

1. Verify that the virtual machine has been created.

## Task 3: Create ManufacturingVM

1. On the Azure portal, open the **PowerShell** session within the **Cloud Shell** pane.

1. Deploy the following ARM templates to create the VMs needed for this exercise:

   >**Note**: You will be prompted to provide an Admin password.

   ```powershell
   $RGName = "ContosoResourceGroup"
   
   New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName $RGName -TemplateFile ManufacturingVMazuredeploy.json -TemplateParameterFile ManufacturingVMazuredeploy.parameters.json
   ```
  
1. When the deployment is complete, go to the Azure portal home page, and then select **Virtual Machines**.

1. On **ManufacturingVM**, select **Connect &gt; RDP**.
1. On **ManufacturingVM | Connect**, select **Download RDP file**.
1. Save the RDP file to your desktop.
1. Connect to ManufacturingTestVM using the RDP file, and the username **TestUser** and the password you provided during deployment. After connecting, minimize the RDP session.
1. On the Azure Portal home page, select **Virtual Machines**.
1. Select **CoreServicesVM**.
1. On **CoreServicesVM**, select **Connect &gt; RDP**.
1. On **CoreServicesVM | Connect**, select **Download RDP file**.
1. Save the RDP file to your desktop.
1. Connect to CoreServicesTestVM using the RDP file, and the username **TestUser** and the password you provided during deployment.
1. On both VMs, in **Choose privacy settings for your device**, select **Accept**.
1. On both VMs, in **Networks**, select **Yes**.
1. On CoreServicesTestVM, open PowerShell, and run the following command: ipconfig
1. Note the IPv4 address. 

 

## Task 5: Test the connection between the VMs

1. On the **ManufacturingVM**, open PowerShell.

1. Use the following command to verify that there is no connection to CoreServicesVM on CoreServicesVnet. Be sure to use the IPv4 address for CoreServicesVM.

   ```Powershell
   Test-NetConnection 10.20.20.4 -port 3389
   ```

## Task 11: Test the connection between the VMs

1. On the **ManufacturingVM**, open PowerShell.

1. Use the following command to verify that there is now a connection to CoreServicesVM on CoreServicesVnet. Be sure to use the IPv4 address for CoreServicesVM.

   ```Powershell
   Test-NetConnection 10.20.20.4 -port 3389
   ```

1. The test connection should succeed, and you will see a result similar to the following:

   ![Test-NetConnection succeeded.](../media/test-connection-succeeded.png)

1. Close the Remote Desktop connection windows.

Congratulations! You have configured a VNet-to-VNet connection by using a virtual network gateway.
