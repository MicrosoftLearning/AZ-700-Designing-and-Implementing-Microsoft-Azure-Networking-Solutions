## Key takeaways

Congratulations on completing the lab. Here are the main takeaways for this lab. 

+ Azure VPN Gateway is a service that provides secure connectivity between your on-premises networks and Azure virtual networks.
+ Site-to-Site (S2S) connections connect your on-premises network to an Azure virtual network using IPsec/IKE VPN tunnels. Ideal for hybrid cloud scenarios.
+ Point-to-Site (P2S) connections connnect individual clients to an Azure virtual network from remote locations. VPN protocols inlcude OpenVPN, IKEv2, or SSTP. Useful for remote workers.
+ VNet-to-VNet connections connect two or more Azure virtual networks using IPsec/IKE VPN tunnels. Suitable for multi-region or multi-VNet deployments.
+ Different VPN Gateway SKUs offer varying levels of performance, throughput, and features.
